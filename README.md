# Pipework Generator
## 1 Introduction
Modelling pipework in CAD is typically not a straightforward task, especially at the point of assembling a manifold. I've seen a few tools in CAD software, such as Autodesk Inventor, which attempt to address this, but the task still takes longer than you would expect.

I believe manifold design is largely programmatic and should be as quick to design in CAD as it is to simply draw with pen and paper.

The aim of this project is to design a python wrapper around either OpenSCAD or FreeCAD, such that a CLI interface can generate complex pipework manifolds, with minimal configuration.
